**Atomic Motion Base v1.1** is a servo and DC motor driving base specifically designed for the ATOM series of main controllers. The product provides 4 channels of **servo** interfaces and 2 channels of **DC motor** interfaces, along with two onboard **Grove** interfaces, allowing for easy connection to various sensors and expansion devices. In terms of communication, it uses the **I2C** communication method and is equipped with an STM32 control chip to ensure stable data transmission. For power supply, it includes a built-in 18350 lithium battery (900mAh) and an **INA226** current/voltage detection chip to monitor battery voltage, current, and power in real-time, ensuring safe and stable system power supply. Additionally, it features overload protection to effectively prevent damage from excessive loads. The product also includes a battery charging function, ensuring that the battery can be conveniently charged to extend usage time. The onboard independent power switch design allows users to easily turn the power on and off. This product is suitable for multi-servo control, robot development, smart device prototyping, and automation experiments.
